GRAPHENE WORDPRESS THEME README
by Syahir Hakim
http://www.khairul-syahir.com

The Graphene theme is a stylish, neat, and tight WordPress theme built for WordPress 3.0. It supports many (if not all) of the new features introduced in WordPress 3.0 as well as a host of other features introduced in earlier versions of WordPress.

Graphene theme is compatible with IE6, IE7, IE8, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome. I haven’t tested with Opera, but this theme is compatible even with IE6, so there’s a good chance it is compatible with Opera as well.


FEATURES

    * Two-column layout, with widgetised sidebar on the right.
    * Built-in Twitter widget to place in the sidebar. You can determine the title to display as well as how many latest tweets you would like to be displayed, all from the WordPress’ Widgets admin page.
    * (WordPress 3.0) Supports custom header images. A total of 7 default header images are included with the theme (see the theme’s readme.txt for image credits). You can also upload and set your own header image through the WordPress admin page.
    * (WordPress 3.0) Supports custom header text. You can choose the color of the header texts, or if they should be displayed at all!
    * (WordPress 3.0) Supports custom background. You can upload your own background and set your own colour, all through the WordPress admin page.
    * (WordPress 3.0) Supports post thumbnails. You can now upload and set a featured image for any posts or pages, and the featured image will replace the header image when that post/page is viewed.
    * (WordPress 3.0) Supports custom menu. You can now set your own menu through the WordPress custom menu feature. If no custom menu is defined, the theme will display all of your pages as the menu.
    * Dropdown menu of up to 3 levels deep.
    * Theme’s options page. I have created an option page for this theme in WordPress admin under Appearance, so that you can modify certain parts of the theme without delving into the codes.
    * Built-in AdSense placement. All you have to do is enter your Publisher’s ID and Ad Slot and activate the feature through the theme’s options page.
    * Built-in AddThis social sharing button placement. Choose your AddThis button and enter the button code and activate the feature through the theme’s options page.
    * Supports threaded comments up to 10 levels deep.
    * Pluggable function definitions, so that you can easily override or add functionalities to the theme easily by using child theme, leaving the theme’s codes unchanged so that your modifications won’t disappear next time there’s an update to the theme.
    * Helpful 404 Error page. Instead of just displaying an error page with arcane message, the theme displays a friendly message telling the visitor what happened and provides a search box. It even does a courtesy search for the user automatically based on the url!
    * Supports translation. All texts in the theme are wrapped in gettext function call so that you can translate all the strings from the theme’s graphene.pot file.
    * Properly formatted HTML elements. I spent a lot of time formatting every single html element that you might use, including all the headings from h1 down to h6, blockquotes, code, and even dt! I know the default browser styling is ugly, so I leave nothing to it. Having said that, if I miss any element do let me know!
    * Lean and mean codes. I take pride in writing validated XHTML and CSS codes. This theme’s coding follows the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Note that due to the usage of a few bits of CSS3 in a CSS2.1 stylesheet, validating the CSS will yield a few errors.
    * Wide browser compatibility. Did you see the list of compatible browsers above? The freaking IE6 is there too!
    * Uninstall option. When you decide not to use the theme anymore, you can use the uninstall button in the theme’s option page to delete all the theme’s options from the database. I’ve been using WordPress for a few years now, and I know orphaned database entries are not desirable, so I make sure the theme I coded do not leave any orphans!
