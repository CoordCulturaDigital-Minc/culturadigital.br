<h2><b>Twenty Ten Weaver Theme Documentation -- Version 1.4</b></h2>
<h4><a href="#v4releasenotes" title="Important notes about V 1.4">See
Version 1.4 Release Notes for new features and changes.</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Twenty Ten Weaver</em> (TTW) Wordpress theme is a pure
child theme of the new Wordpress 3 standard <em>Twenty Ten</em> theme.
<em>Twenty Ten Weaver</em> allows you to change many of the colors and
other aspects of the standard <em>Twenty Ten</em> theme. In addition,
it allows you to easily add whatever special code you might need (such
as advertising tracking code), all without having to get into the
depths of Wordpress theme code.</p>
<p><em>TTW </em>allows you to build a custom site look by tweaking
many of the style rules for your Wordpress blog. You can get a very
customized look just by picking colors and layout options. While the <em>Main
and
Advanced Options</em> control panels may look overwhelming, they
really aren't that hard to use once you play with them a bit. This <em>Help</em>
document has lots more information to help you design your own site
look by changing many of the the standard <em>Twenty Ten</em> theme
styles. Don't know what a style is - don't worry, you just have to pick
colors and click on check marks.</p>
<h3>How to get started:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Select one of the predefined sub-themes. There are over a dozen
to choose from.</li>
  <li>Go to the <em>Main Options</em> panel. You'll see a list of
options you can change. Play around with them, and see how the theme
you selected changes. This may be enough to get a custom theme you like.</li>
  <li>If you have ad-sense code, or other code from a similar site, you
can easily add it to your site in the <em>Advanced Options</em> panel.</li>
  <li>Finally, read the help page. There are lots of tips there, as
well as fairly detailed explanations of exactly which CSS rules TTW
supports, and hints on how to go beyond the basics and really customize
your site.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Twenty Ten Weaver vs. 2010 Weaver</h4>
<p>You may have seen there are two versions of Weaver. The two versions
function exactly the same. The only difference is whether or not you
have to have the default Wordpress Twenty Ten theme installed. The
Twenty Ten Weaver version is what is known as a pure child theme, and
you must have Twenty Ten installed as well. The 2010 Weaver version
already includes Twenty Ten in its files, so it will work without
Twenty Ten.</p>
<p>The main reason there are two versions is that the Wordpress.org
theme library will now allow pure child themes, and so the 2010 Weaver
versions is the one available for direct download from there. You can
even have both versions installed, and can switch back and forth, but
you won't see any differences.</p>
<h4>Using With Wordpress Multisite</h4>
<p>Twenty Ten Weaver (and 2010 Weaver) will work with no additional
settings on Wordpress Multisite installations. Because the <em>Advanced
Options</em> tab allows people to add Javascript, the <em>Advanced
Options</em> and <em>Save/Restore</em> tabs may be <em>disabled</em>
by changing a value in the Weaver settings php file. Administrators of
Multisite installations can edit the <span class="style3">/wp-content/themes/twentyten-weaver/ttw-settings.php</span>
file and change the <span class="style3">'TTW_MULTISITE_ALLOPTIONS'</span>
definition to <span class="style3">false</span>, which will then
disable the Advanced Options and Save/Restore tabs. This setting might
make a Multisite installation slightly more secure.</p>
<h3>Design Hints</h3>
<p>This section has a few hints on designing your own theme.</p>
<p>Latest Help Info</p>
<p>This help document is current as of the time of the release of this
version of Twenty Ten Weaver. The latest revisions of this help page
can be found at <a href="http://wpweaver.info/downloads/readme.html">Twenty
Ten
Weaver Help</a>.</p>
<h4>Choosing Colors</h4>
<p>Good themes use related colors. Many times (but not always), when
you look at the Main Options page, you'll notice that all the colors of
the should "look good". They don't have to, but having a nicely
matching set of colors.</p>
<p>The color picker has an interesting feature. Once you pick a color
from the left section, the right bar shows different brightness levels
of that color. This is especially useful for making a color lighter or
darker.</p>
<p>Some themes use the same colors for all links, some vary. But using
the same link hover color for all the different kind of links lends
consistency to your theme. The same is true for the other colors - try
for a consistent look in your theme.</p>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>There a a couple of tricks that can help make testing you theme
easier. First is the preview window at the bottom of the theme settings
tabs. However, you might find it easier to open a new tab in your
browser. Open the theme admin page on one tab, and the main site on the
other. After you make a change (and save them), you can toggle to the
second tab and refresh the page.</p>
<p>Another important thing is to change just one thing at a time. This
may seem to take longer, but you will really be able to see the effect
of your change this way and be sure it does what you want.</p>
<h4>Saving Option Settings</h4>
<p>After you make any changes to the values of the Main or Advanced
Options, you must save your changes. If you navigate away from the
design tabs without first saving your values, everything will be lost.
This is typical behavior for most Wordpress settings screens.</p>
<p>After you save your settings, the preview window at the bottom of
the Twenty Ten Weaver admin page will be updated to show the effects of
your settings.</p>
<h4>Saving Your Own Theme</h4>
<p>Once you have a design you like, you can click the "<em>Save in My
Saved Theme</em>" button near the bottom of the <em>Main Options </em>tab
to
save your theme. You restore that saved theme by selecting it from
the Sub-Theme list. Your saved theme will then overwrite all options,
including the <em>Advanced Options</em>. This is the one way to
preserve all your work, so when you get something you like, save it.
You can then fiddle and fine tune more without losing your previous
work.</p>
<h4>Sidebar and Content Widths</h4>
<p>This table gives the maximum width of the usable areas of sidebars
and other areas depending on which sidebar scheme you've selected - <em>using
the
standard width of 940px.</em> Usable area is the maximum width of
an image you could put in the area and still maintain the appropriate
margins in area. These numbers will change if you use a custom theme
width.</p>

<p>(Note: it is mostly because of all the different sidebar choices
that TTW does not let you change the overall width of the theme. The
inter-relationships of the different sidebars are too complex to allow
both different sidebar arrangements and a total width option.)</p>
<h3>Twenty Ten Predefined Sub-Themes</h3>
<p><em>TTW</em> comes with over a dozen predefined themes. You can use
them as-is, or as a starting point for your own designs. When you
select a new sub-theme, <em><strong>all</strong></em> the options
values from the <em>Twenty Ten Weaver Main Options</em> are cleared
and set to the new values of the sub-theme. Most of the Advanced
Options are not changed - except the Special Overrides are set to the
values required by the new sub-theme.</p>
<h2>Twenty Ten Weaver Main Options</h2>
<p>This document gives some hints for using TTW, as well as describing
some of the technical aspects used to develop the theme. The things you
can control have been divided into </p>
<p class="box"><em><strong>Advanced Note</strong></em>: Included at the
end of each description is some CSS code contained in <span class="css">{braces}</span>.
This
information includes which CSS style rules are used to control the
desired attribute. This information can be useful for those of you who
know a little CSS. For example, all the link attributes use some form
of the "<span class="css">a</span>" tag. You can add underlining or
change font style of links by adding an appropriate CSS style entry to
the <span class="css">&lt;HEAD&gt;</span> section of the advanced
options.</p>

<h2>Twenty Ten Weaver Advanced Options</h2>
<p>The Advanced Options page allows you to save pieces of HTML code
required by third-party plugins and widgets. You can also use them to
save Google Maps/Analytics/AdSense javascript snippets. You will need
to understand a bit of HTML coding to used these fields effectively.</p>
<p>The values you put here are saved in the Wordpress database, and
will survive theme upgrades and other changes. When you select a new
sub-theme, all the <em>Advanced Options</em> are left untouched
(except the <em>Special Theme Overrides</em>, which are set by the new
sub-theme). However, if you pick "My Saved Theme", then all Advanced
options are replaced. The idea is that you can use the Advanced Options
to set up things you want, and try different sub-theme looks without
losing your work. But if you restore "My Saved Theme", then you should
get back what you really saved.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: NO validation is made on the field values, so be
careful not to paste invalid code. Invalid code is usually harmless,
but it can make your site display incorrectly. If your site looks
broken after you add stuff here, please double check that what you
entered uses valid HTML commands. Also note that backslashes will be
stripped.</p>
<hr> <label><b>&lt;HEAD&gt; Section</b></label> <br>
Code entered in the <span class="css">&lt;HEAD&gt;</span> box is
included right before <span class="css">&lt;/HEAD&gt;</span> tag in
your site. You can add <em>custom CSS</em> here to further enhance the
look of your site. The section covering the various include sub-themes
includes specific examples of CSS used to get a particular effect.
Another use is for <span class="css">&lt;META&gt;</span> tags for
description or bot search terms. (This field is also useful for
entering links to javascript files or anything else that belongs in the
<span class="css">&lt;HEAD&gt;</span>, but this use will be uncommon -
usually you can find a WP Plugin to do what you need.) <br>
<br>
<br>
<label><b>Site Header Insert Code</b></label>
<p>This must be HTML markup code (including WP shortcodes), and will be
inserted into the #branding div header area right above where the
standard site header image goes. You can use it for logos, better site
name text - whatever. When used in combination with hiding the site
title, header image, and the menu, you can design a completely custom
header. </p>
<p>Note that this code will be after or before the default Primary menu
depending on the move menu setting. You can completely replace the
default menu (hide it), but you will have to hard-wire the links to
pages in your replacement menu. </p>
<p>If you hide the title, image, and header, no other code is generated
in the #branding div, so the code here can be a complete header
replacement. You will almost certainly need to add some CSS style, too.
(We've added a class called ttw-center which you can use to div-wrap
your insert code to center it:<br>
<span class="css">&lt;div class="ttw-center"&gt;[shortcode]&lt;/div&gt;</span>)
</p>
<p>You can also override the CSS <span class="css">#branding </span>rule,
create
a new <span class="css">div</span>, or use in-line styling. One
of the most flexible capabilities of the section is the ability to
embed Wordpress shortcodes. This might be most useful for adding a
rotating header image using a plugin such as Meteor Slides or WP-Cycle.</p>
<p>For example, assume you've installed the Meteor Slides plugin, and
have uploaded your rotating header images for the plugin to use. To add
this slide show header image, you should first disable the default
header image by setting the header image size to zero in the <em>Main
Options</em> tab. Then, add this code to the Site Header Insert Code
box:</p>
<p><span class="css">&lt;div
class="ttw-center"&gt;[meteor_slideshow]&lt;/div&gt;</span></p>
<p>Note that the built-in <span class="css">ttw-center</span> CSS
class will ensure the slide show is displayed properly. Without
appropriate CSS styling, you may get unexpected placement of the plugin
output. The <span class="css">ttw-center</span> class will usually do
what you want.</p>
<label><b>Site Footer Area</b></label> <br>
This code will be inserted into the site footer area, right before the
before the "Powered by" credits, but after any Footer widgets. This
could include extra information, visit counters, etc. You can use HTML
here, so include style tags if you want! And like the Site Header
Insert Code section, you can also use shortcodes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<label><b>The Last Thing</b></label> <br>
This code is inserted right before the closing <span class="css">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
tag. This is the best place for your Google analytics code other final
code that is not usually displayed. <br>
<br>
<br>
<label><b>Special Theme &lt;HEAD&gt; Section Overrides</b></label> <br>
The entries in this field are usually generated by some of the example
themes provided with Twenty Ten Weaver. You can fiddle with them, but
it is generally better to use the regular <span class="css">&lt;HEAD&gt;</span>
overrides. (Note: this code is included before the standard <span
 class="css">&lt;HEAD&gt;</span> section code above.) <br>
<h2>Twenty Ten Weaver Advanced Topics</h2>
<h2>Custom Menus</h2>
<p>One of the new features included with Wordpress 3 is support for
custom menus. By using the <em>Appearance-&gt;Menus</em> panel, you
can create a menu completely under your control. While the standard
Twenty Ten only supports one custom menu, Weaver supports two. If you
have defined two custom menus, they will be placed above and below the
site header image.</p>
<p>Custom Menus can let you really customize site navigation. One
typical use of multiple menus is one for pages, the other organized by
category or tags. But you have complete control. However, which menus
show can be a bit confusing. There are three specific cases of
specifying menus that are most likely to be useful:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>No Custom Menus Defined</strong><br>
This might be the most common case. If you don't use the <em>Menus</em>
panel, and don't define any custom menus, then the theme will
automatically generate a menu based on your pages (including Home)
using the page order defined in the page editor when you create pages.
This is the legacy method, and works fine for many situations.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Defining One or Two Custom Menus</strong><br>
You can also define one or two custom menus. The two menus supported by
Weaver are called the Primary and Secondary Menus. If you define a
Primary Menu, then it will be the main menu bar normally under the
Header Image. If you don't define a Secondary menu, then only one will
be displayed. If you define the Secondary Menu, then it will normally
be displayed above the Header Image. You can switch the order of the
two menus either using the <em>Main Options</em> tab, or by switching
the order in the <em>Menus</em> panel.<br>
    <br>
Normally, both menu bars will use the same menu bar color scheme. When
you've selected the rounded area option, the top menu bar will have the
top edge rounded, and the bottom menu bar the lower edge rounded. This
look great with a square Header Image.<br>
    <br>
You can use CSS snippets to change the color of the Secondary menu bar
- it uses <span class="css">#access2</span> for its CSS tags.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Define Only Secondary Custom Menu</strong><br>
If you define only the Secondary Menu and leave the Primary Navigation
theme location blank, then Weave will display two menu bars - the
Secondary Menu bar on top as you defined, and the default menu with
pages (as discussed in #1 above) on the bottom menu bar.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Default Color Values</strong><br>
The default color values for the various elements you can change are
the same values as used in the parent Twenty Ten theme. When an item
has the default value, the color is inherited from the parent theme -
no CSS is generated to override the parent color. <br>
    <br>
Sometimes, however, you might want to use the default color, but still
have a CSS rule generated. One case, for example, is having white
content or sidebar backgrounds while having a different body background
color. Because no CSS will be generated for those backgrounds if the
default "#FFFFFF" value is used, you have to use some trickery - like
using a close non-default value. The "Dark - 2 Right Sidebars" theme
demonstrates this. The theme uses "#FFFFFE" for those background
colors, which is almost pure , to force a CSS color property to be
generated so the sidebars show up in white. If the default were used,
the backgrounds would inherit the dark surrounding background.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Things you can't do</strong><br>
Because of the design of Twenty Ten Weaver as a "strict" child theme of
Twenty Ten, there are some things you can't really do using CSS
overrides. For example, the Sidebars are placed outside of the main
content area.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Notes</h2>
<p>The <em>Twenty Ten Weaver</em> theme is a child theme of the <em>Twenty
Ten</em> theme now standard for Wordpress 3. As this theme is currently
implemented, all the changes you can make to the default <em>Twenty Ten</em>
theme are accomplished using CSS style rules.
Don't worry - you don't have to know them to use the options panel of
TTW. But that does mean that there is nothing you can do about the
order that the content is generated by the parent theme. But mostly
that doesn't matter - the parent theme has made many very good choices
on how it generates site content. </p>
<h2><a name="divhierarchy" id="divhierarchy"></a>Twenty Ten HTML
&lt;div&gt; Hierarchy</h2>
<p>The Twenty Ten theme generates content that is wrapped in HTML
&lt;div&gt;'s with a set of conventional names. A typical site page
will have the following hierarchy. Knowing this can help you make
additional custom modifications. (Another useful thing to do is to use
the "View Document Source" option of your web browser to see the actual
HTML generated by Wordpress for your site content.)</p>
<pre class="codebox">#wrapper<br>	#header<br>		#masthead<br><br>  # main<br>	    #container<br>			#content<br>				#comments<br><br>		#primary<br>		#secondary<br>	#footer<br>		#colophon</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Notes on Example Themes</h2>
<p>Here are some notes to discuss some of the special CSS rules that
were added to give the sub-themes a better look, as well as other
aspects of the designs. Note that this code is part of the internal
theme definition, but is displayed in the <em>Special Theme
&lt;HEAD&gt; Section Overrides section</em> of the Advanced Options
panel. You can accomplish similar effects by adding rules to the <span
 class="css">&lt;HEAD&gt;</span> section. It is better not to use the
Special Theme section since that gets replaced if you select a new
theme. Code in the <span class="css">&lt;HEAD&gt; </span>section is
preserved.</p>
<h4>Dark - 2 Left Sidebars</h4>
<p>This theme add a very simple rule that is used in some of the other
themes - it adds some space below the widget title. You can use the
same style name to change the font style, add a box, or whatever. But
adding space seems to help the look of some themes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="codebox">.widget-title {margin-bottom:10px;}</p>
<h4>Blue</h4>
<p>This style rule adds some space to the top of the content box to
make the theme look a bit better.</p>
<p class="codebox">#content{padding-top:15px;}</p>
<h4>Dark with Green</h4>
<p>This makes a couple of things italic, and adds some padding to the
top of the content box.</p>
<p class="codebox">.entry-title {font-style:italic;}<br>
#content{padding-top:15px;}<br>
#branding h1 {font-style:italic;}</p>
<h4>Reds</h4>
<p>The Reds theme uses several CSS styles to help give it its look. The
ones with <span class="css">border</span> values add the white bars.
The <span class="css">#branding</span> rules add the right color at
the top. And we add some italic.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="codebox">#main{border-top-style:solid; border-top-width: 5px;
border-top-color: #FFFFFF;}<br>
#primary{border-left-style:solid; border-left-width: 5px;
border-left-color: #FFFFFF;padding-top:10px;}<br>
#content{padding-top: 10px}<br>
#secondary{border-left-style:solid; border-left-width: 5px;
border-left-color: #FFFFFF;}<br>
.widget-title {margin-bottom:12px;}<br>
#branding{background-color:#660000;}<br>
#branding a{margin-left:15px;font-style:italic;}<br>
#content h2, #content h1{font-style:italic;}</p>
<h4>Tan and Gray</h4>
<p>We use the #header rule to fix the color at the top. We add some
padding to the site title, and fiddle with margins in the footer. We
make the blog post titles bigger.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="codebox">#header{background-color:#9D8851;}<br>
#content{padding-top:15px;}<br>
.entry-title h1,.entry-title
a{font-size:30px;font-weight:normal;line-height:35px;}<br>
.widget-title
{font-size:30px;font-weight:normal;line-height:35px;margin-bottom:5px;}<br>
#colophon a{color:#333333;}#branding a{margin-left:15px;}<br>
#footer-widget-area{margin-left:10px;}</p>
<h4>Orange</h4>
<p>This adjusts the widget titles, and add some padding and dotted
borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="codebox">.widget-title
{font-size:130%;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom: 1px dotted #C4BCB0;}<br>
#content p{padding-left:15px;}<br>
#content .post {border-top: 1px dotted #DBD2C4;border-bottom: 1px
dotted #C4BCB0;margin-bottom:10px;}</p>
<h4>Simple Silver</h4>
<p>These two rules add the boxes around the post information. Note that
the post information comes partly at the top and partly at the bottom
of the post content. Many themes combine this information into one
section, but Twenty Ten has the information split around the post.
Changing this would require more than simple style rule changes.</p>
<p class="codebox">.entry-meta {padding:4px 0 4px
20px;background-color:#F8F8F8; border: solid 1px
#A0A0A0;font-style:bold;}<br>
.entry-utility {padding:4px 0 4px 20px;background-color:#C0C0C0;
border: solid 1px #A0A0A0;font-style:bold;}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Ivory Drive example notes</h4>
<p>The Ivory Drive example is based on the web site of Ivory Drive
(IvoryDrive.com). As is the case with several of the example themes,
you have to set the header in the Appearance Admin menu to the Ivory
Drive header.</p>
<p>This example has a couple of interesting items. First, the header
image was crafted to fit with the left-hand sidebar. The left hand
sidebar is 240px wide, so the band photo on the left was made to be
240px. This led to a header image height of 167px. So as you can see
from this example, it is possible to craft a special header image that
corresponds to the settings of the rest of your theme.</p>
<p>We use the <span class="css">{.widget-title}</span> style to
override the color of the bar under the widget titles. Here's the code:</p>
<pre class="codebox">.widget-title {border-bottom: 2px solid #737373; font-variant: small-caps;}</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>More Help - Suggestions</h3>
<p>The <em>Twenty Ten Weaver</em> page at WPWeaver.info allows
comments. You can leave questions or comments there. No promises on how
quickly you will get a response, however. I have a lot of other
projects going, and travel some, so I might not get a chance to respond
immediately, but I will try. If this theme becomes popular, I might
create a support forum for it. But for now - just comments.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking out <em>Twenty Ten Weaver</em>. Hope you create
a beautiful Wordpress theme with it!<!-- end #mainContent --> </p>

<p><strong><a name="changes13" id="changes13"></a>Changes to Weaver
Functionality</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Area Background Colors</strong></p>
<p>The most significant change to Weaver involves how the background
colors of the major areas are handled. These background colors are set
in the Theme Background Colors section of the Main Options tab of the
admin page. These are the areas, and the corresponding CSS &lt;div&gt;
names:</p>
<table class="attrs">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="left" width="25%">Wrapper Page BG:&nbsp;</td>
      <td style="padding-left: 10px;"><small>Background for top level
#wrapper div - default BG if you don't change others. <span class="css">{#wrapper}</span></small></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Main Area BG:&nbsp;</td>
      <td style="padding-left: 10px;"><small>Background for main page
#main div - wraps container, content and sidebars (uses wrapper bg if
not set). <span class="css">{#main}</span></small></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Container Area BG:&nbsp;</td>
      <td style="padding-left: 10px;"><small>Background for #container
div - wraps content and sidebars (uses wrapper bg if not set). <span
 class="css">{#container}</span></small></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Content BG:&nbsp;</td>
      <td style="padding-left: 10px;"><small>Background for post and
page content area (uses main bg if not set). <span class="css">{#content}</span></small></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">XX Widget Area BG:&nbsp;</td>
      <td style="padding-left: 10px;"><small>Background for the four
widget areas. <span class="css">{#primary, etc.}</span></small></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Footer BG:&nbsp;</td>
      <td style="padding-left: 10px;"><small>Background for the footer
area. <span class="css">{#footer}</span></small></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Outside BG:&nbsp;</td>
      <td style="padding-left: 10px;"><small>Background color that
wraps entire page. Using Appearance-&gt;Background will override this
value, or allow a background image instead.<span class="css">{body}</span></small></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Previous versions of Weaver had gotten this wrong in two ways.
First, it used White as the background colors for the &lt;div&gt;'s
nested inside the #wrapper &lt;div&gt;. This was partly from a
limitation in the color picker that didn't allow <em>transparent</em>
as a value. It turns out that <em>transparent</em> is the "correct"
value for these &lt;div&gt;'s. The <a href="#divhierarchy">chart</a>
that shows the &lt;div&gt; hierarchy can help understand how these
&lt;div&gt;'s interact.</p>
<p>If you've set colors for most of your own BG areas, then it is
likely you will see no difference in how your theme looks. However, 1.3
has added the "Container" setting. The previous versions incorrectly
set the #container &lt;div&gt; using the "Content BG" setting. Each of
these settings now apply to the correct &lt;div&gt;. <span
 class="style2">If you have an issue with your content area not having
the correct background color or incorrect rounded corners, try setting
the new Container Area BG to the old value, and set the current Content
BG to <em>transparent</em> and things should be fine.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. Theme Save File Extension</strong></p>
<p>The file extension used for Weaver saved theme files. Previously,
the extension was <span class="style3">.txt</span>. That has been
changed to <span class="style3">.wvr</span>. The actual format of the
file has not changed. If you have old themes saved, simply rename them
and change the extension from <span class="style3">.txt</span> to <span
 class="style3">.wvr</span>.</p>
<p><strong>3. SEO Tags</strong></p>
<p>A new advanced option called "SEO Tags" has been added. Search
Engine Optimization is somewhat of a black art, and this provides
minimal support. The difference is that previously, the meta tags now
included here were in the &lt;HEAD&gt; Section, which meant your tags
were saved in any themes you saved, which isn't exactly correct. Now,
these SEO meta tags are not saved with theme settings, but are just
site specific. If you had filled in the meta tags on your old versions,
you should remove them from the &lt;HEAD&gt; Section, and copy them
here.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Last Thing</strong></p>
<p>Just as the SEO tags don't belong with the theme, the code you
include in this section are site specific. They will not longer be
saved with a theme. If you have an old saved theme, however, the
settings will be copied over automatically.</p>

<h2><a name="v4releasenotes" id="v4releasenotes"></a>Version 1.4
Release Notes </h2>
Weaver 1.4 has a few changes and some new features. This is a summary
of the changes:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Two new sub-themes<br>
Transparent Dark and Transparent Light. These two themes use
transparent backgrounds, and can make truly beautiful sites when used
with an appropriate background image or solid color.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Icons for Post Meta Info<br>
A set of icons suitable for using with the Meta Information above and
below Blog Posts has been included. You can use the default set (a gray
theme that works well with almost any color) with a Main Options check
mark, or use custom CSS in the &lt;HEAD&gt; Section. There is also a
check mark option to remove the fill-in text (e.g., 'Posted on', 'by',
etc.) in the info lines, which allows a very nice icon-only look. There
are a number of icons available for your custom use in the
/wp-content/themes/twentyten-weaver/images/icons directory.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Advanced Option to customize copyright<br>
You can now put a totally customized copyright notice in the footer to
replace the automatically generated one. There is also a check mark to
hide the "Powered by" credit if you really don't want to give credit to
WordPress and WPWeaver.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Advanced Option to Clear the Weaver database<br>
Sometimes it is just best to start over. This new option allows you to
clear the existing Weaver settings back to the original default values.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Internet Explorer fixes<br>
Code was added to support rounded corners in the upcoming IE 9. A long
unreported problem with a bug in IE that made it display the color
boxes&nbsp; was fixed to work around the problem.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
