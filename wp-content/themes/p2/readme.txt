=== P2 ===

A group blog theme for short update messages, inspired by Twitter.

== Description ==

P2 is shorter, better, faster, stronger.
http://p2theme.com/

P2 is a theme for WordPress that transforms a mild-mannered blog into a super-blog with features like inline comments on the homepage, a posting form right on the homepage, inline editing of posts and comments, real-time updates so new posts and comments come in without reloading, and much more.

P2 is available on WordPress.com: http://wordpress.com/signup/?ref=p2
...or you can download it for WordPress.org: http://wordpress.org/themes/p2

You can also check out a demo of the theme in action: http://p2demo.wordpress.com/
