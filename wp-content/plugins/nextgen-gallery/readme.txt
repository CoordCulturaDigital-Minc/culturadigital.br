== Description ==

= WordPress Gallery Plugin =

NextGEN Gallery is the most popular **WordPress gallery plugin**, and one of the most popular WordPress plugins of all time, with over 7.5 million downloads.

It provides a powerful engine for uploading and managing galleries of images, with the ability to batch upload, import meta data, add/delete/rearrange/sort images, edit thumbnails, group galleries into albums, and more. It also provides two front-end display styles (slideshows and thumbnail galleries), both of which come with a wide array of options for controlling size, style, timing, transitions, controls, lightbox effects, and more.

*The NextGEN Gallery WordPress gallery plugin is now proudly maintained by <a href='http://www.photocrati.com'>Photocrati Media</a>. Special thanks to Alex Rabe who created and maintained NextGEN from 2007 through 2011.*

**NEXTGEN GALLERY 2.0: MAJOR UPDATE IN JULY 2013.** *We released a major update and overhaul to NextGEN Gallery in July 2013. NextGEN Gallery 2.0 presents a completely reworked interface, both for the central options panel and for adding galleries to pages and posts. It's dramatically more powerful and flexible.*

**INTRODUCING NEXTGEN GALLERY PRO.** *Along with NextGEN 2.0, we're happy to announce a "Pro" upgrade to NextGEN. NextGEN Pro offers 6 new gallery displays, including Pro Masonry, Pro Filmstrip, Pro Film, Pro Thumbnail Grid, Pro Slideshow, and Pro Blogstyle galleries. It also includes a responsive, fullscreen, mobile-friendly Pro Lightbox with commenting and social sharing for individual images within galleries.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Why are my galleries not opening up in a lightbox after I move my site? =

This is often due to the URL paths to the CSS and JavaScript files used by the Lightbox Effects not being changed to relevant addresses based on the new site. This article will help sort out this issue if that is the case: <a href="http://www.nextgen-gallery.com/galleries-opening-lightbox/" target="_blank">Why are my galleries not opening up in a lightbox?</a>. 

= Do you have documentation or tutorials? =

Yes. See <a href="http://www.nextgen-gallery.com/help/" target="_blank">NextGEN Gallery Documentation</a>.

= Will NextGEN Gallery work with my theme? =

Part of what makes the NextGEN Gallery WordPress gallery plugin so popular is its flexibility - it works with the vast majority of premium and free themes, without requiring any coding.


= Are the galleries flash based? =

No, NextGEN Gallery uses Javascript (J-Query) based displays to ensure compatibility across the widest range of displays possible.


= Are the galleries mobile friendly? =

Yes, since we use Javascript rather than flash, NextGEN Gallery is compatible with Android, iOS, and Blackberry. As of July 2013, all galleries are responsive. NextGEN Pro also includes a full screen, responsive Pro Lightbox with mobile gesture support. 


= What is the difference between a gallery and an album? =

In the simplest of terms, Galleries contain your images and Albums contain your Galleries. Albums act as links and placeholders to quickly and easily navigate your galleries - Galleries will actually display your images.


= Can I upload multiple images at once? =

Yes, you can batch upload entire galleries at a time.


= Can I password protect galleries? =

Yes, WordPress allows you to password protect pages by default - which includes all galleries and content for the entire page. Password protection of pages can be turned on and off at any time, with just a few clicks.


= Can I add a watermark to the images/slideshows? =

Yes, you can add text or image watermarks to your gallery images.


= Can I crop thumbnails? =

Yes, each thumbnail image can be individually adjusted to suit your needs.


= Is there pagination for galleries? =

Yes, and you can adjust the amount of images to be shown on a page at any time.


= Can I customize the lightbox? =

Yes, the lightbox can be configured with multiple options directly from the Dashboard, and there are multiple CSS styles which can be applied and modified as well.


= Can I add HTML to the captions? =

Yes, caption areas are fully HMTL capable.


= Can I add an external links to galleries? =

Since the captions are fully HTML capable, you can add external links and any other type of mark up you wish.


= Is NextGEN Gallery available in foreign languages? =

Yes, the NextGEN Gallery WordPress gallery plugin has been translated into dozens of languages - <a href="http://www.nextgen-gallery.com/languages/" target="_blank">click here to find out more.</a>
