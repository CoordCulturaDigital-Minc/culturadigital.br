This plugin provides site and group based wiki functionality for a Buddypress installation.

== Description ==
DO NOT INSTALL THIS PLUGIN ON A LIVE SITE.  THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION ONLY.
This plugin provides site and group based wiki functionality for a Buddypress installation.

This is a completely new version of the BuddyPress Group Wikis plugin.  

The plugin is now based on the BuddyPress Skeleton Component and has been rewritten from the ground up to take advantage of internationalisation support, BuddyPress standards for ajax, function hooks and several months of BuddyPress/wordpress experience (as compared to very little before writing the original group wiki plugin).

Key features as compared to the original plugin:

* No multi-blog functionality required (utilises WP3.x's "custom post types" methods).
* Support for custom templating of pages.
* i18n support.
* Built in such a way to allow easy extension to support site-wide wikis and namespaces.
* Uses proper BuddyPress/Wordpress post submit and ajax methods.
* User controllable wiki page deletion.
* Group wiki data cleaned up properly on group deletion.
* Better text diff methods.
* More stuff.

DEVELOPMENT VERSION - NOT ALL FUNCTIONALITY AVAILABLE YET

This plugin is still under heavy development.  Expect to see releases frequently over the next couple of weeks.

As always, support can be obtained and feedback can be given at:
