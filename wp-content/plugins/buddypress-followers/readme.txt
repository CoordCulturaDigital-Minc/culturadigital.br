== Description ==

Add the ability for users to follow others and keep track of their site activity. This plugin works exactly the same way that the friends component of BuddyPress works, however the connection does not need to be accepted by the person being followed.

The plugin integrates seamlessly with your site, adding a new activity stream tab, follow/unfollow buttons to user profiles and adds menus to display the users following/followed and total counts.

== Installation ==

 1. Copy buddypress-followers to /wp-content/plugins/
 2. In the Wordpress Admin panel, visit the plugins page and Activate the plugin.
 3. To follow a user, visit their profile and hit the follow button under their name.
