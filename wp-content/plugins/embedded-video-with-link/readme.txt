Stable tag: 4.1

Easy embedding of videos from lots of portals or local video files of many file formats with optional generation of a corresponding link.

== Description ==

CAUTION! The newest version of this plugin is not compatible with WP versions before 2.5! But if you use an older version, you can at least use version 3.4 of this plugin.
CAUTION! If you use the automatic plugin update of wordpress when migrating from version 4.0 to a newer one, you have to activate manually as directory structure changed. Delete the folder "embedded-video" in your plugins folder afterwards, only "embedded-video-with-link" is still valid!

Please rate this plugin! Please donate!

The plugin is made for easily embedding videos into a blog post. The videos can be integrated from external portals (like YouTube, Google Video and many many others) or they can be uploaded to the web server or a remote server and integrated as well. Additionally a corresponding link to the video on the particular video portal page or a download link to the local file can be generated automatically, if demanded. The linktext is also configurable individually.
Furthermore a fixed prefix for the linktext can be determined. 
The videos can be integrated easily by using the built-in WYSIWYG editor. The plugin generates XHTML-valid code and works from WP 2.5.

The following video portals are currently supported:

* YouTube
* Google Video
* dailymotion
* MyVideo
* Clipfish
* Sevenload
* Revver
* Metacafé
* Yahoo! Video
* ifilm
* MySpace Video
* Brightcove
* aniBOOM
* vimeo
* GUBA
* Garage TV
* GameVideos
* vSocial
* Veoh
* Gametrailers

The following file formats for local and remote files are currently supported:

* flv, swf (demands Flash Video Player on web server, see installation instruction)
* mov, qt (demands Quicktime Plugin on client browser)
* wmv, mpg, mpeg, mpe, asf, asx, wax, wmv, wmx, avi (demands a media player plugin (like Windows Media Player) on client browser)

== Installation ==

Copy the subfolder "embedded-video-with-link" with all included files into the "wp-content/plugins" folder of WordPress. Then go to the menu "Administration" > "Plugins" and activate it. 
If you want the plugin to play own Flash videos (FLV/SWF files), you need to add [JW FLV Media Player](http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=JW_FLV_Player) manually. Download the zip-file, extract it and simply copy the containing folder ‘mediaplayer’ to the plugin folder ‘embedded-video-with-link’.

Note: If you want to use the FLV Media Player commercially, a license fee has to be paid! See above linked page for license information.

== Configuration ==

The configuration options are simple and do not need explanation. See the administration panel of the plugin in your WP admin frontend.
