msgid "The plugin searches PHP files for instances of get_option('option_name as a string') to match against values found in the wp_options table. Some files however use syntax such as get_option(&#36;variable) or get_option('prefix_' . &#36;variable). These option names will not match those found in the wp_option table, and they may be present in the list of Orphaned Options when in fact they are not really orphaned. In many cases, knowing the file, and the prefix if used, should help in identification of options that are not really orphaned.<br />*Note, if you get this warning with a plugin file (from the <u><i>WordPress.com Plugin Directory only</i></u>, please) and you know it's not a potential problem (eg. some WordPress core files, the WordPress.com Stats plugin, and this plugin have alternate syntax in them BUT <u><i>there are no options associated with them listed</i></u>), please visit the blog and leave a comment something like \"the whatever plugin has alternate syntax but is OK\" and I can add it to the \"ignore\" list for future version releases if it is safe to do so. Many Thanks. %s"

msgid "The plugin queries the wp_options table. It expects an array with at least 1 row. This error message may be the result of fact. i.e. There actually are no wp_option rows with autoload=yes (next to impossible), or there actually are no \"rss_hash\" rows. Or it could be an actual database problem (eg. connection failure, memory failure). If you get this error message you should look for a WPDB error message as well for more detailed information. An error with either the autoload=yes query (core/plugin/theme options), or the autoload!=yes query (rss_hash options) means that none of the corresponding rows will be available for review or deletion until the database problem is resolved."
