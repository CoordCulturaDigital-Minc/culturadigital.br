== Installation ==

Before installing the JW Player plugin, please ensure your WordPress installation meets the following requirements:

* WordPress 3.0 or higher
* PHP 5.0 or higher
* The wp-content/uploads directory needs to be writable by the plugin.  This is likely already the case as WordPress stores your media and various other uploads here.

<strong>Initial Install</strong>

1. To install the plugin, extract the <em>jw­player­plugin­for­wordpress.zip</em> and FTP the folder to your WordPress plugins directory (<em>/wp­content/plugins/</em>) on your web server.
1. Login to your WordPress website and navigate to Site Admin &raquo; Plugins. The JW Player Plugin will appear in the list of plugins. Click the <strong>Activate</strong> link to enable the plugin.
1. At this point, the plugin is ready to be used. However, if you own a commercial JW Player license, you should set your Player Edition and License Key in the <em>JW Player &raquo; Settings</em> screen.

Alternatively, you can install the plugin right from your <em>WordPress admin dashboard</em>.  Simply search for <strong>JW Player</strong> in the plugin section of the admin.  WordPress will download and install the plugin for you automatically.

If you cannot perform the automatic update, download the plugin and upload, or FTP the plugin to the plugins folder directly.
