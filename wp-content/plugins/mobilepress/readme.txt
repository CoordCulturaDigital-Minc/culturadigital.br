MobilePress is a plugin for WordPress that renders a mobile friendly
version of your WordPress website or blog.

== Description ==

MobilePress is a plugin for WordPress that renders a mobile friendly
version of your WordPress website or blog. It allows for custom themes
and a few other mobile friendly settings.

The latest 1.2 release of MobilePress is a rewrite and restructuring of the
plugin as it moves towards a MobilePress 2.0 release in the near future. The
idea behind the 1.2 release is to push these changes to the existing base
and then constantly push new updates with exciting features over the next few weeks.

Please do leave feedback and file bugs at the dedicated support forums on the [WordPress plugin directory](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/mobilepress).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the "mobilepress" folder into your "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.

== Upgrade Notice ==

The MobilePress 1.2 update will delete your existing settings and replace it with
a new set of default settings, which you can edit through the "MobilePress" menu
in WordPress.

If you have custom themes, please back up before updating to MobilePress 1.2.
You can do so by creating a new directory: /wp-content/mobilepress/themes/ and copying all existing themes into the new directory.
