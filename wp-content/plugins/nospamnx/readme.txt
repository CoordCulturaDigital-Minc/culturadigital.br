To protect your Blog from automated spambots, this plugin adds invisible formfields to your comment form.

== Description ==

There have been many new good ideas of fighting automated Spam in WordPress. Most of these Plugins (like the antecessor of NoSpamNX: Yawasp) change the name of one (or more) of your comment field. On the one hand, this is indeed more effective, but on the other hand, this goes to the expense of compatibility. Therefore, NoSpamNX does not change any of your comment fields, but still claims to be very effective.

Many Antispam Plugins focus on user interaction, e.g. captcha or calculations to defend you against automated comment spambots. Some use JavaScript and/or Sessions. NoSpamNX intend to handle automated comment-spam-protection without these measures. It does not require JavaScript, Cookies or Sessions. It does not change any of your comment template fields, given you more compatibility with other WordPress- or Browser Plugins.

NoSpamNX automaticly adds additional formfields to your comment form, invisible to human users. If a spambot fills these fields blindly (which most of all spambots do), the comment will not be saved. You can decide if you want to block these spambots or mark them as spam. Furthermore, you can put common spam-phrases on a local Blacklist or (if you have multiple Blogs) on a global Blacklist. This comes very handy when fighting against "handmade" Spam.

NoSpamNX works best with a wordpress default theme (e.g. TwentyEleven, TwentyTwelve, etc.)

= Requirements =

Make sure your theme loads <code>comment_form</code> in the Comment-Template (comments.php) according to the WordPress Codex - see http://is.gd/1lezf - otherwise NoSpamNX will not work properly!


= Features in a Nutshell =

* Easy installation (just activate the plugin)
* Easy configuration (only two options)
* Increased spam protection when using WordPress default Theme
* Local Blacklist to block specific Phrases, URLs, Domains, IP-Ranges, etc. (use it to block "handmade" Spam)
* Global Blacklist for multiple WordPress Blogs
* Does not require JavaScript, Cookies or Sessions
* Does not require any extra field for user input (e.g. Captcha, Calculations, Pictures, etc.)
* No need to manage spambot comments (if you don't want to)
* No Database queries except for a few WordPress Options
* False-positives are nearly impossible


= Compatibility =

* Compatible with bbPress
* Compatible with WPtouch (Mobile Theme)
* Compatible with WordPress Multi-Site feature (see FAQ)

== Installation ==

1. Unzip Plugin
2. Copy the nospamnx folder to your wp-content/plugins folder
3. Activate plugin
4. (Optional) Adjust settings (Settings -> NoSpamNX)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After I updated to a new Version all comments are marked as Spam! =

The best way to deal with this Problem, is to uninstall the Plugin via the WordPress Backend and re-install the Plugin.

= After I updated to a new Version the Options are reseted! =

Update to at least Version 3.14. Since this Version the Options are not rested when the plugin is updated.

= I use OpenID and after Installation all comments are marked as Spam! =

NoSpamNX does not work with OpenID.

= I use BuddyPress and after Installation all comments are marked as Spam! =

NoSpamNX does not work with BuddyPress.

= Does NoSpamNX work with WordPress Multi-Site feature? =

Yes, but you have to activate the plugin for each site individually.

= Can I block IP-Adresses and IP-Ranges with the built-in blacklist? =

Yes, just add an IP-Address (e.g. 10.23.23.4) in the Blacklist or use CIDR-Notation (e.g. 10.43.8.67/28) to block IP-Ranges.

= Does the plugin block Ping-/Trackback Spam as well? =

No, the plugin focus on automated Spambots only and I have no plans of changing that. There are some really good Plugins in the WordPress Plugin Repository which can do that for you.

= What about false-positives? =

Due to the functionality of NoSpamNX false-positives are nearly impossible. There 'might' be problems when using WordPress Cache-Plugins, but none have ever been reported. If you are uncertain, mark Spambots as Spam instead of blocking them.
